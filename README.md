#  Cristina — Computer Engineering Student | Future MedTech Engineer

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,c,cpp,python)](https://skillicons.dev)

Hi! I'm Cristina — a Computer Engineering student with a growing passion for **MedTech**, **neuroscience-inspired computing**, and **AI that supports human health**.  
I love building things that connect **software, hardware, and people** — whether it’s a small robotics project, a UI prototype, or experimental AI models.

I’m motivated by curiosity, structure, and the desire to understand how things work (especially the brain).

##  What I'm Currently Working On

###  DrawMeMaybe — AI + Robotics Project  
A university project combining creativity, image processing, and robotics.  
➡️ Users upload a photo → choose interests → a robot arm draws a stylized portrait.

**My focus:**
- Designing and developing the **user interface**
- Working on **AI-based image generation** and **prompt creation**
- Leading **planning and task organization** within the team
- Gaining perspective on **image preprocessing** and **robotics** from my colleagues
