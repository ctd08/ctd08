#  Cristina — Computer Engineering Student | Future MedTech Engineer

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,c,cpp,python)](https://skillicons.dev)

Hi! I'm Cristina -  a Computer Engineering student with a growing passion for **MedTech**, **neuroscience-inspired computing**, and **AI that supports human health**.  
I love building things that connect **software, hardware, and people** - whether it’s a small robotics project, a UI prototype, or experimental AI models.

I’m motivated by curiosity, structure, and the desire to understand how things work.

## My last projects

###  DrawMeMaybe — AI + Robotics Project  
A university project combining creativity, image processing, and robotics.  
Users interact with a web app → upload a photo → choose interests → a robot arm draws a stylized portrait live on paper

**My focus:**
- Designed and developed the **user interface** and **project pipeline**
- Worked on **AI-based image generation** and **prompt creation**
- Led **planning and task organization** within the team
- Gained perspective on **image preprocessing** and **robotics** from my colleagues
